Risk Profiles (CDRP) Risk Explorer tool provides quantitative data to explore, visualize and derive Earthquake, Windstorm and Flood (hazard, exposure and risk) information via an interactive interface.  The Risk Explorer is focused on Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama) and some Caribbean countries (Jamaica, Grenada and St Lucia).","about-2":"For more detailed information on a particular area (e.g. department or province), you can click on the area to view general information like GDP, exposure of buildings and non-building infrastructure. The user can also explore three key risk metrics such as the Average Annual Loss (AAL), Probable Maximum Losses (PMLs) and scenario losses based on historic events.","about-3":"The tool also provides aggregate level cost and benefit analysis for replacement or retrofitting options of buildings. For example, in Guatemala nearly 10% of economic value associated with residential buildings is in single-family houses of mud (adobe) wall construction, housing nearly 16% of the country’s population. If these houses were replaced by earthquake-resistant reinforced masonry with concrete diaphragms, there would be a significant reduction to the country’s earthquake AAL. For a pre-defined scenario, applied to the most seismically prone department of Guatemala, Escuintla, we find that the department’s AAL could be reduced by over 7%. For this, you can launch an interactive calculator at the bottom of the results panel to determine different risk mitigation options.","Who can I contact for further information?":"Who can I contact for further information?","about-4":"If you encounter any issues using the tool or would like further explanations on the data shown, please contact","Made Possible Thanks To":"Made Possible Thanks To",Disclaimer:"Disclaimer","about-6":"Results presented here are part of the ongoing WB LCR Country Disaster Risk Profile (CDRP) Program.

Por ejemplo, en Guatemala casi el 10% del valor económico asociado con edificios residenciales son casas unifamiliares de muros de adobe, que albergan casi el 16% de la población nacional. Si estas casas fueran reemplazadas por mampostería reforzada resistente a terremotos con diafragmas de hormigón, habría una reducción significativa en la pérdida anual media por terremoto del país. Para un escenario predefinido, aplicado al departamento más propenso a sismos de Guatemala, Escuintla, nos encontramos con que la pérdida anual media del departamento podría reducirse en más del 7%.
